EnSeven uses [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/docs/) to connect two players to a game of hangman played directly from their terminal windows. A user can either create a new account or log into an existing account upon connection to the game server. Their wins and losses will be kept track of every time they complete a game. 

## Playing the Game

In order to play this game, a user will need to fork the client repo and clone it down to their machine. They can use [this](https://github.com/EnSeven/client) link to access the repository. 

1. Once the repository is on their computer, they will then need to install all dependencies (by typing **npm install** into their terminal) before starting up the game.
2. In order to start a game, a player will need to type **nodemon** into their terminal. They will then be connected to the game server and will then be prompted to either CREATE an account or LOGIN to an existing account.
